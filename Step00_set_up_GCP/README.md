Nanyan "Rosalie" Zhu and Chen "Raphael" Liu

## Overview.
To the best of our knowledge, new users to the google cloud platform are granted $300 worth of computational resources for free. Students affiliated to academic institution may ask their professors whether or not the courses they are enrolled in cooperate with GCP. If so, it is likely that even more GPU-hours can be available.

## Step-by-step instructions.

1. Go to [https://cloud.google.com](https://cloud.google.com).

2. You will see an interface similar to this (though it might change from time to time)
