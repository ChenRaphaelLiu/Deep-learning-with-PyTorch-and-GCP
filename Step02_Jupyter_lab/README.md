# Managing Jupyter Lab.
Nanyan "Rosalie" Zhu and Chen "Raphael" Liu

- Activate the environment you need to work with
    - conda activate [myenv]
- Install a jupyter notebook kernel in the respective environment
    - python -m ipykernel install --user --name [myenv] --display-name "[Python (myenv)]"
- Now the jupyter kernel is distinctively pointing to the python in the corresponding environment
