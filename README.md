# Deep Learning with PyTorch and Google Cloud Platform
Nanyan "Rosalie" Zhu and Chen "Raphael" Liu, Columbia University

## Overview
This tutorial is designed for the course BMEN4460 instructed by Dr. Andrew Laine and Dr. Jia Guo starting from the Spring 2020 semester at Columbia University. Since we are a medical imaging group, this repository will mainly focus on applications in medical imaging.

This repository is still in progress. We will add one new post per week. Please help us improve this repository by leaving your comments or problems you encountered in the "Issues" section.

- Step 00: [Set up Google Cloud Platform (GCP)](https://github.com/RnR-2018/Deep-learning-with-PyTorch-and-GCP/tree/master/Step00_set_up_GCP).
- Step 01: [Manage anaconda on GCP](https://github.com/RnR-2018/Deep-learning-with-PyTorch-and-GCP/tree/master/Step01_manage_anaconda_on_GCP).
- Step 02: [Set up Jupyter Lab](https://github.com/RnR-2018/Deep-learning-with-PyTorch-and-GCP/tree/master/Step02_Jupyter_lab).
- Step 03 (optional): [Set up a graphical user interface (GUI) on GCP](https://github.com/RnR-2018/Deep-learning-with-PyTorch-and-GCP/tree/master/Step03_GUI_setup%20(optional)).

## Children Repositories.
1. [Simple cell segmentation with a single layered perceptron](https://github.com/RnR-2018/BMEN4460-NB1-simple_cell_segmentation_with_a_single_layered_perceptron), introduced in Step 02.

### Additional resources.
1. [Jupyter Notebook Tricks](https://www.dataquest.io/blog/jupyter-notebook-tips-tricks-shortcuts/). Quite cool. There are a lot of things that we never heard of.
2. [Udacity Online Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning-nanodegree--nd229). This is not free, and not relevant to the course BMEN4460 at all. It is just a course we looked into personally. We are not paid or anything to advertise this.
